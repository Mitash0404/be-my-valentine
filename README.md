# Will you be my Valentine?

A simple, one-page Valentine's ask. Host it on GitHub Pages and share the link.

## Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repo (e.g. `valentine` or `will-you-be-my-valentine`).
2. Push this folder into the repo (just `index.html` and this README).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages** → Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: **main** (or **master**) → folder: **/ (root)** → Save.
4. After a minute or two, your page will be at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

Share that link when you're ready to ask.
